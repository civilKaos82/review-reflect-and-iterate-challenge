# Review Reflect And Iterate

##Summary

One of the best learning opportunities we get as programmers is the opportunity to read other peoples code and apply what we learned.

### Learning Goals
* Apply lessons you've learned from reading other peoples code
* Discover how re-attempting challenges affects their difficulty

##Releases

###Release 0

Choose two of the hardest challenges from this weekend, then read, dig into, and comment on 3 other members of your cohorts attempts for each of these challenges. Make sure you include:
  * Something you learned from their attempt
  * Something you think they did well
  * Something you think could be more in line with the [four rules of simple design](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/BeckDesignRules.html)

Feel free to ask other people to explain things to you. Remember, your understanding is the most important part.

Now, redo your most difficult challenge. Focus on the applying the things you learned from the review you did as well as the four rules of simple design.

Once you have re-completed the review challenge, answer the following questions:

- How did reviewing other peoples code impact your second attempt?
- What questions did you dive into when reviewing the other code?
- Did you run into any dead ends that you don't understand? Enumerate 2 or 3 of the dead ends you dove into.
